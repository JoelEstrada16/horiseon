## Description
 I found it really fun doing this homework and going through each semantic elements you can use and ways you can shorten and cut code, it felt like I was doiong one giant puzzle which helped me get through it since I love finding ways you can get around and rebuild stuff. I did this so I can get more comfortable building and matching code together from html and css. This made me learn that there are always ways you can get the same outcome but from different or shortened codes.
